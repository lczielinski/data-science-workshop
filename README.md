1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your personal computer

"Forking" means to copy the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do whatever you want to a forked repository and it won't affect this one, only the repository on your own account.

"Cloning" means to download the repository and its files to your computer. You can now make changes to the files on your computer and then "push" the changes to GitHub. Think of this process like downloading a Word document from Google Drive, editing it on your computer, and then uploading it again into Google Drive.
